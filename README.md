# Net Salary Calculator

This repository contains a Java program that calculates an employee's **net salary** after a standard tax deduction.

The program works by prompting the user for three essential pieces of information: the **hourly wage**, the **total number of classes/hours worked** in a month, and the **INSS deduction percentage**. It then automatically calculates the **gross salary**, the **INSS value**, and the final **net salary**, presenting a clear summary of all values.
